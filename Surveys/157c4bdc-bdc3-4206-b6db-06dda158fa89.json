No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?\"","createdAt":"2022-01-25T07:44:49.071Z","questions":{"0":{"0":"What is Lorem Ipsum?","1":"Why do we use it?","2":"Where does it come from?","3":"Where can I get some?","sectionTitle":"The first section is here"},"1":{"0":"Section 1.10.32 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\", written by Cicero in 45 BC","1":"Section 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\", written by Cicero in 45 BC","sectionTitle":"The standard Lorem Ipsum passage, used since the 1500s"}},"answers":{"0":{"0":{"0":true,"1":true,"2":true,"3":false},"1":{"0":true,"1":true},"createdAt":"2022-01-25T07:46:05.706Z"},"1":{"0":{"0":true,"1":true,"2":true,"3":true},"1":{"0":true,"1":true},"createdAt":"2022-01-25T07:46:24.417Z"},"2":{"0":{"0":false,"1":false,"2":false,"3":false},"1":{"0":false,"1":false},"createdAt":"2022-01-25T07:46:35.115Z"}}}

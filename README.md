# How to run the backend

To run this project:

1. In terminal run `npm install`
2. In terminal run `npm run start`
3. There is no step three!

# In Production

For persisting the data in a production environment, I would definitively use a Database (A Non-relational database in fact - MongoDB for example -), it's more secure, more performent, more error tolerant, and more reliable. But since the application is simple, using files - even in production - is totally fine unless when the load increases where we need a DBMS. I don't know if I managed to answer the question, but this is my understanding of it.
